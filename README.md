  ## Goals

  Create a CMS-style blog site from scratch, where developers can publish their blog posts.

  ## Motivation

 Developers spend plenty of time creating new applications and debugging existing codebases, but most developers also spend at least some of their time reading and writing about technical concepts, recent advancements, and new technologies. 

  ## Usage

  This blog can be used to create, view, edit and delete posts.

  ## Installation
  
  npm install       followed by:  npm run       followed by: node server.js  

  ## Test

  N/A

  ## Problems

  The problems that I experienced from this project arose mostly from 1) the sheer number of files and 2) the deployment to Heroku.  I'm glad that I overcame these problems and learned from them in the process.
